Before reading anything, I want to tell you that this is NOT an advertisement. It’s just my recommendations. Also, I still recommend you to pay Glitch for “Forever Alive” to keep them running.
By the way I’m not a native English speaker so this post might contain some mistakes. Thank you.
3 ways to deal with Glitch banning pinging service
	1.	Change to Repl.it 43 Repl.it 43 is a similar website to Glitch. It can even let you program in more languages such as Python, Ruby and more. I recently changed my bot to there to keep it running as it accepts pinging service to keep your project “alive”. It works almost perfectly for a 24/7 Discord bot. The only problem is that music commands will not work, or specifically, the moment the bot joins a voice channel. You will receive the error Connection not established within 15 seconds. I’m sure the problem only occurs in Repl.it as I tested it in Glitch and locally. The website is also completely free like Glitch. 
	2.	Change to Heroku 6 You might have heard of this one as many people talk about that. This site is a perfect way to host a Discord bot as its downtime is minimal. No problem has been found so far. However, unlike many people said, this service is NOT completely free. The site introduce a thing called Dyno hours, which is the hours you can get your application on. For free accounts, you only have 550 Dyno hours. That’s about 21.9 days a month. As there is no need to keep pinging, I still recommend it. 
	3.	Localhost If you don’t know what is localhost, it simply means that you host it on your computer. This can be a really good solution as it does not rely on any other websites. You just need your computer. Although the performance varies with your computer and internet, it is still a good way. However, in order to keep your Discord bot running 24/7, your computer also needs to be running 24/7. 
Here’s what I think that can help you out if you were using Glitch for your Discord bots. Good luck with your bots!
